# Apigee Remote Service for Envoy

This project exposes standard Envoy gRPC endpoints for the `External Authorization (ext-authz)`
and `gRPC Access Log Service (ALS)` interfaces. Thus, it allows Envoy to be used as a limited
remote API Gateway extension to an Apigee environment. Features directly supported include:
authentication and authorization via API Key or JWT OAuth Tokens, Distributed Quota, and Analytics.

Health check and prometheus management endpoints are also exposed.

See [releases](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-remote-service-envoy/releases) for current binary and docker images.

## Getting Started

Documentation is available [here](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/envoy-adapter/concepts).

## Support

Issues filed on Github are not subject to service level agreements (SLAs) and responses should be
assumed to be on an ad-hoc volunteer basis. The [Apigee community board](https://community.apigee.com/)
is recommended as for community support and is regularly checked by Apigee experts.

Apigee customers should use [formal support channels](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/support).
