# Creates a RequestAuthentication and AuthorizationPolicy for JWTs.
# This causes Istio to evaluate JWT tokens passed to workloads labeled as `managed-by: apigee`.
# The `originIsOptional: true` flag allows requests with missing or invalid JWTs
# to continue in case a valid x-api-key value can be evaluated by Apigee.
# Replaces authentication Policy in Istio 1.5+.

# You must update the issuer and jwksUri for your environment.
