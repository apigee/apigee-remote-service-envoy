# Creates a RequestAuthentication and AuthorizationPolicy for JWTs.
# This causes Istio to evaluate JWT tokens passed to workloads labeled 
# as `managed-by: apigee` in the default namespace.

# Important: Replace ${RUNTIME} in the configuration below!

# Note: An AuthorizationPolicy sample is shown below and commented out.
# By not having an AuthorizationPolicy, either API Keys or JWTs can be
# used by clients. If you enable the AuthorizationPolicy, JWT tokens will
# be required and API Keys will not work by themselves.
