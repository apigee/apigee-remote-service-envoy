# Creates a RequestAuthentication for httpbin.
# This causes Istio to evaluate JWT tokens passed to httpbin services.
# The `originIsOptional: true` flag will allow requests with missing or invalid JWTs
# to continue in case a valid x-api-key value can be evaluated by Apigee.
# Replaces authentication Policy in Istio 1.5+.

# You must update the issuer and jwks_uri for your environment.
