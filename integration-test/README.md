### Run the test locally

*NOTE*: The test scripts serve the Kokoro builds internally. As of now they do not create a sandbox environment. Instead they rely on existing Apigee platforms and credentials. Therefore, running the scripts locally still require permission to access those resources and they are not meant for general use. However, some functions defined in `scripts/lib.sh` might appear to be useful.

Given proper access to the credentials, the script below can be used to simulate the Kokoro builds locally.

GCloud SDK command-line tool, Go 1.15+ and jq are required.
